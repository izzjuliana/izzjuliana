# Juliana Prada | Computer Science Student

Hi! I'm Juliana Prada, a rising sophomore at the University of Florida majoring in Computer Science, with a passion for using technology to create meaningful change.

This summer I explored machine learning through Break Through Tech at Cornell Tech, where I built predictive models using real-world data. I’m especially excited by the intersections of AI, ethics, and social impact—particularly in areas like education, healthcare, and public policy.

From hackathons to communities like Rewriting the Code and Latinas in Tech, I love being in spaces where I can learn, build, and collaborate. These experiences have shaped me not only as a programmer, but also as an advocate for inclusion in tech.
